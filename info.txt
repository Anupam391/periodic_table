Hydrogen

Named after the Greek words hydro for "water" and genes for "forming,"
Melting point: minus 434.7 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 259.34 degrees Celsius)
Boiling point: minus 423.2 F (minus 252.87 C)
Atomic weight (average mass of the atom): 1.00794
Phase at room temperature: Gas
Robert Boyle produced hydrogen gas in 1671 while he was experimenting with iron and acids
The element was named hydrogen by the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier.
It is found in the sun and most of the stars, and the planet Jupiter is composed mostly of hydrogen
On Earth, hydrogen is found in the greatest quantities as water. 
It is present as a gas in the atmosphere only in tiny amounts â€“ less than 1 part per million by volume.

Helium

French astronomer Pierre Janssen was on-hand in India to watch, and to measure the sun's atmosphere, known as the chromosphere.
Melting point: minus 458.0 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 272.2 degrees Celsius)
Boiling point: minus 452.07 F (minus 268.93 C)
Atomic weight (average mass of the atom): 4.002602
Phase at Room temperature: Gas
On the Earth, most helium is a radioactive decay product of uranium and thorium. It is found under the Earth's crust with other natural gases. 
Helium is used for medicine, scientific research, arc welding, refrigeration, gas for aircraft, coolant for nuclear reactors, cryogenic research
and detecting gas leaks.
NASA uses helium as an inert purge gas for hydrogen systems and a pressurizing agent for ground and flight fluid systems. 
Helium has many unique properties: low boiling point, low density, low solubility, high thermal conductivity and inertness
Helium was the first gas used for filling balloons and dirigibles.
