    `Hydrogen is the number one element of the periodic table and earns
this status for a range of reasons: along with helium and lithium, it
was one of the first three elements produced during the BigBang; it
is the most abundant element in the universe, accounting for 88
percent of all atoms; and it is the lightest of all the elements, with
only one proton (which is why it is number 1 in the periodic table)
and one electron`

    `Helium is named for the Greek God of the sun, Helios, after it was
first detected as unknown yellow spectral lines in sunlight. In India
in 1868, French astronomer Jules Janssen passed sunlight through
a prism during a solar eclipse (to split the light into its component
colors). He found a sudden jump in the brightness of yellow light,
which he initially believed to be caused by sodium`
